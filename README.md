ShroomShadeForest
//HOW DOES IT WORK?
//    Just make a tree and a shroom with your cool asss shader on them. 
//    Tree needs a collider
//    Mushroom needs some other stuff, just duplicate one of the prefabs to see. 
//    When you place them into ForestGen, they should be in the same spots on their respective lists
//    I.e. if your GreenGoo shader tree is number 6 in the tree prefabs list, GreenGoo shader shroom should be number 6 in shroom prefabs list
//    That's it!
//    hit play, WASD, click to pick up Shroom, left click to eat, right click to drop.
